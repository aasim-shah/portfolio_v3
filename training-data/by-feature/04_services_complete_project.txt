SAMPLE QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:

Q: What's the difference between this and individual services?
A: Complete Project Development includes everything: website, mobile app, admin panel, backend, and deployment. Individual services focus on one component. This package saves 20-30% versus ordering services separately.

Q: Do I really need a mobile app?
A: If your target users access services on mobile frequently, yes! Mobile apps 
offer better user experience, offline functionality, push notifications, and higher engagement than mobile websites.

Q: Can you start with website and add mobile app later?

A: Yes! I can build the backend API to support both, launch the website first, then develop the mobile app in phase 2. This approach reduces initial investment while planning for growth.

Q: How many revisions are included?
A: Each major milestone includes 2 rounds of revisions. This covers design review, functionality review, and final review before launch. Additional revisions are charged separately.

Q: What if I need to make changes mid-project?
A: Minor changes are accommodated. Major scope changes require change order with adjusted timeline and pricing. I'll always discuss impact before proceeding.

Q: Do you help with app store submission?
A: Yes! I assist with Apple App Store and Google Play Store submission, including preparing assets, writing descriptions, and handling the technical submission process.

Q: What happens after the 90-day support period?
A: You can continue with ongoing maintenance package, pay hourly for support as needed, or manage it yourself with the documentation and training provided.

Q: Can you scale the project in phases?
A: Absolutely! Many clients start with MVP (Minimum Viable Product) with core features, launch to validate the market, then add features in subsequent phases based on user feedback.
