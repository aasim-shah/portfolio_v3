SAMPLE QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:

Q: What is DevOps?
A: DevOps combines development and operations to automate software deployment, testing, and infrastructure management. It enables faster, more reliable releases through automation and continuous integration/deployment.

Q: Why use AWS for hosting?
A: AWS offers reliability (99.99% uptime), scalability (auto-scaling), security (enterprise-grade), cost-effectiveness (pay-as-you-go), and a comprehensive suite of services for any application need.

Q: What's included in CI/CD setup?
A: Automated testing on every code commit, automated deployment to staging/production, rollback capabilities, environment management, and integration with your Git repository (GitHub, GitLab).

Q: How much does AWS hosting cost?
A: For small applications: $20-$100/month. Medium applications: $100-$500/month. Large applications: $500-$2,000+/month. Exact cost depends on traffic, storage, and services used.

Q: Can you migrate my existing application to AWS?
A: Yes! I handle complete migrations including database migration, application deployment, DNS configuration, SSL setup, and ensuring zero downtime during the transition.

Q: Do you provide monitoring and alerts?
A: Yes! All deployments include CloudWatch monitoring, custom dashboards, error alerts, performance metrics, and log aggregation for troubleshooting.

Q: What if something breaks after deployment?
A: I provide post-deployment support, monitoring alerts for issues, automated backups for quick recovery, and rollback capabilities in the CI/CD pipeline.

Q: Can you set up auto-scaling?
A: Absolutely! I configure auto-scaling groups that automatically add or remove servers based on traffic, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.
