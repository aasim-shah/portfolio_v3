FREQUENTLY ASKED PRICING QUESTIONS:

Q: Can I pay in installments?
A: Yes! Projects 6+ months can be paid monthly. Otherwise, payment follows milestone schedule (30/40/30).

Q: What if my budget is limited?
A: We can phase the project or reduce scope to fit your budget. I'll recommend the best approach to maximize value within your constraints.

Q: Are there any hidden costs?
A: No. All costs are outlined in the proposal. Infrastructure costs (hosting, domains) are clearly separated from development costs.

Q: Can I get a discount for a large project?
A: Possibly. Contact me with your project details and budget for a custom quote. Long-term contracts often receive better rates.

Q: What if the project takes longer than estimated?
A: Fixed-price projects are honored regardless of time. Hourly projects may exceed estimates if scope expands - I always communicate this before additional charges.

Q: Do you require contracts?
A: For projects over $1,000, yes. A simple service agreement outlines scope, timeline, payment terms, IP rights, and cancellation policy.

Q: What payment method is most secure?
A: For Pakistan clients, SafePay offers buyer protection. For international clients, PayPal provides dispute resolution. Bank transfers are also accepted.
