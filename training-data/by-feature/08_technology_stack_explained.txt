SAMPLE QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:
============================

Q: Why not use WordPress or other CMS?
A: For simple websites, WordPress works. For custom applications with complex logic, unique workflows, or specific integrations, custom development with MERN stack offers better performance, security, and scalability.

Q: Is MERN stack suitable for mobile apps?
A: MERN stack is perfect for mobile app backends (APIs). For mobile apps themselves, I use Flutter which integrates seamlessly with MERN backends.

Q: What if I want to use Python or PHP?
A: While I specialize in JavaScript/Node.js, I can integrate with Python or PHP backends if needed. However, my expertise and efficiency are highest with MERN stack.

Q: Is Node.js secure?
A: Yes, when implemented correctly. I follow security best practices including input validation, authentication, encryption, and regular updates. Node.js powers Netflix, PayPal, and NASA.

Q: Can MERN stack handle high traffic?
A: Absolutely! MERN stack is used by companies like Netflix, LinkedIn, and Uber. With proper architecture (caching, load balancing, CDN), it handles millions of users.

Q: What's the difference between MongoDB and PostgreSQL?
A: MongoDB is NoSQL (flexible schema, JSON documents) - great for rapid development. PostgreSQL is SQL (structured schema, relations) - great for complex queries and data integrity. I recommend based on your specific needs.

Q: Do you use the latest versions?
A: I use stable, production-ready versions. Not bleeding edge (risky), but not outdated. I stay current with LTS (Long Term Support) releases.

Q: Can you work with my existing tech stack?
A: If it's JavaScript-based (Node.js, React, etc.), definitely. For other stacks, I can integrate or migrate to MERN if beneficial.

STAYING CURRENT:
================

I continuously update my skills through:
- Official documentation
- Online courses and tutorials
- Tech conferences (virtual & in-person)
- Open source contributions
- Personal projects
- Tech blogs and newsletters
- Developer communities

TECHNOLOGY RECOMMENDATIONS:
===========================

I provide honest technology recommendations based on:
- Your specific needs
- Budget considerations
- Timeline requirements
- Team capabilities
- Long-term goals

I won't push expensive or unnecessary technologies. Goal is right tool for the job, not newest or most expensive.
